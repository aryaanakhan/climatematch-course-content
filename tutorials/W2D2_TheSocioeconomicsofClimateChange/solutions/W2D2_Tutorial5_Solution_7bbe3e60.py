Strengths: SSPs are an approach that nicely balances (biased) expert opinion with more objective (but perhaps inaccurate) models. The framework underlines the importance of baseline assumptions on resulting emissions and temperatures.
There is now more than one baseline/business-as-usual scenario, however, these scenarios result in at least 3.1°C warming (and up to 5.1°C) by 2100.
With the framework, one is easily able to model climate policies and compare them to the benchmark futures. It furthermore allows for climate change-related research globally across research communities and is extendable to other scales, sectors, and issue areas.
Global narrative extensions can be produced and applied in key sectors to support quantitative projections from e.g. energy and land-use models, and projections from IAMs.

Weaknesses: An even larger set of assumptions/complexity leads to overconfidence while complexity and uncertainty are increased. It is not easy to apply SSPs regionally.
Futures with non-neo-classical economics like no or limited growth in high-income countries or scenarios oriented around eco-communalism are not represented in the SSPs.
There might also be plausible futures that are under-represented including those driven by disruptive events, whether technological, social, political, or environmental, e.g. implications of violent conflicts, the crossing of biophysical and social tipping points or unexpectedly rapid technological innovation; for example, in artificial intelligence or energy efficiency.
